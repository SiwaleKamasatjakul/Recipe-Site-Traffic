## Recipe Site Traffic

This problem is sourced from the DataCamp certification.

1.Introduction

About Tasty Bytes Tasty Bytes was founded in 2020 in the midst of the Covid Pandemic. The world wanted inspiration so we decided to provide it. We started life as a search engine for recipes, helping people to find ways to use up the limited supplies they had at home


2.Goals for this project

At the moment, the team choose their favorite recipe from a selection and display that on the home page. They have noticed that traffic to the rest of the website goes up by as much as 40% if they pick a popular recipe, but they donâ€™t know how to decide if a recipe will be popular. More traffic means more subscriptions so this is really important to the company.

The product manager from Tasty Bytes specifically requested to:

Predict which recipes will lead to high traffic.

Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time.
